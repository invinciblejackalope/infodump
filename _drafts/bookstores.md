At this point, I feel like books are kind of a bygone technology. It's not that people don't still read books. Of course they do. Probably thousands of books are written every year. But I do feel like they don't occupy as essential of a role in Americans' lives as they used to.

Before this semester, I hadn't been reading a lot, and most of my friends didn't read much either. Occasionally I'd have a book recommended to me, or I'd see one lying around and pick it up for a few minutes. Maybe this lack of appreciation for books was intensified by going to a technology school, where at least on paper, each discipline has a defined trajectory of technical skills you must learn in order to get where you want to be. This is why we take classes, I suppose -- we learn theory and practice solving problems, which are both more reliant on structured instruction and less on storytelling.

But the glaring reason for people not reading nowadays (I probably deserve to get called a boomer for this) is that as a generation (Gen Z), our constant reliance on technology is providing other, more passive forms of learning / interest capture. Namely, I've recognized my own use of online video and social media to fill my desire to learn when I am too low-energy for books. It sucks though. I feel so drained after consuming media, since I rarely get the knowledge that I actually want, but at the same time it gives me just enough dopamine that I don't want to go without it.

Funnily enough, now that I'm writing this, I realize that I've actually been consuming book-like (longform) media for a while. I read Evan Chen's [Napkin](https://web.evanchen.cc/napkin.html) in high school, and in my first year, I watched most of the [14.13 economics lectures](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63Z979ri_UXXk_1zrvrF77Q) on YouTube. I used to watch other lectures too, particularly math lectures I couldn't really understand, like [this talk](https://youtu.be/LeaiPHAh0X0) by Jacob Lurie. (Reminder to write about category theory sometime.) But I still read a LOT more now than I used to.

In greatest contrast to the present, I had a phase last year when I would read a lot of blogs (see [my other post]({% post_url 2023-05-01-metacommentary %})). I found them to be more efficient, with broad intuitions condensed down into some kind of central maxim that I could apply right away, or a concise opinion piece that told me only the essential details I needed to understand the blogger's viewpoint. If you've read my other post, I clearly take issue with this idea now. But it took me a bit to see the difference.

The story begins at my new living group, a cooperative non-fraternity that runs a rotating mealplan and has unexplainable memorabilia plastered all over its walls. And it has shelves and shelves of books, numbering into the thousands, that admittedly no one really reads.
