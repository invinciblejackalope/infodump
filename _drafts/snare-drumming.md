The YouTube snare drumming community is one of the strangest and most counterintuitive niches I've gotten myself into. I have never played the drums and haven't seriously played any instruments at all after quitting piano when I was 11. Although I do like music and music theory, I haven't thought about rhythms for a long time. The only other thing I can really trace this interest to, aside from the YouTube algorithm, is beatboxing (which I will write another post about shortly!). I guess I've also always liked music with [creative and fast-paced rhythms](https://youtu.be/vQd1xc_RYPs).

Boy am I glad that I found this niche, though, because it's the only way I would have found gems like [this](https://youtu.be/_Dh2v_-_aZU) and [this](https://youtu.be/dv2PkvMkzVo).
