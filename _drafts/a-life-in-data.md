I also want to do a data analysis project at some point since I've been learning so much data science and stats recently, wink wink.

* "schedule" my hourly activity log
* "why life hard" my daily activity log (inactive)
* "sleep log"
* "grocery shopping log"
* "cooking log"
* "interest map"
* "interest timeline"
* "list of songs" numbering in the thousands
* "chord progressions"
* "advertisements"

Here's a little screenshot of one of these logs.
