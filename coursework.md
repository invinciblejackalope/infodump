Here are some notable classes that I've taken. (G) refers to a graduate-level class.

## Math

**6.437 (G) Inference and Information**

A fun and fast-paced class about inferring parameters from data in both Bayesian and non-Bayesian manners. Lots of information theory as well. Get comfortable with taking expectations and integrals of everything and trying to visualize infinite-dimensional spaces of probability distributions.

**18.650 Fundamentals of Statistics**

Statistical theory (Central Limit Theorem repeatedly) and statistical tests such as the Wald test, t-test, permutation tests, etc.

**6.S095 Intermediate Probability Problem Solving**

A very fast-paced and problem-solving oriented class that was difficult to keep up with but a great introduction to using probability in practice.

**18.705 (G) Commutative Algebra**

Rings, ideals, modules, tensor products, Noetherian rings/modules, Dedekind domains, etc. Fun class, though it's in a tough spot because it would feel much more motivated alongside algebraic geometry or number theory.

**18.225 (G) Graph Theory and Additive Combinatorics**

Difficult class with a very Olympiad-like flavor and lots of interesting, deep theory within the niche of extremal graph theory and additive combinatorics. My favorite units were probably graph limits, regularity, and Freiman's theorem.

## CS

**6.869 (G) Advances in Computer Vision**

Traditional computer vision, e.g. Sobel filters, all the way up to modern-day CNNs and ResNet/robust ImageNet. Comes with lots of very nice and some very creepy machine-generated images.

**6.046 Design and Analysis of Algorithms**

Median finding, hashing, flow networks, linear optimization, randomized algorithms, amortized analysis, computability, the whole grab bag.

**6.036 Introduction to Machine Learning**

(Self-study) Lots of theory with interesting perspectives such as Markov decision processes.

**Full Stack App Development**

Learn web app development in a stack of your choice: I learned Django, HTML/CSS/JavaScript (jQuery, D3), PostgreSQL.

**6.147 Battlecode**

Writing instructions for an army of bots. Competitive programming plus strategy. It was also good Java practice.

## Economics

**14.32 Econometrics**

First time I learned about a lot of the really interesting applications of econometrics such as determining correlations between sociological variables like race, gender, education, wage etc., as well as ingenious methods such as IV regression (see my [blog post]({% post_url 2021-12-11-iv-regression %}) about it!).

**14.73 The Challenge of World Poverty**

Turns solving the problem of poverty into something very analytically tractable. This class is solely responsible for me being interested in economics.

**14.75 Political Economics and Economic Development**

The impact of colonialism, whether leaders matter, what causes conflict, all through the lens of economic theory: equations and models.

**14.13 Psychology and Economics**

(Self-study) What are we but partially naive quasihyperbolic discounters?

## Business

**15.076 Analytics for a Better World**

Solving all kinds of optimization problems to make the world better in a very concrete way, using large datasets and powerful optimization tools (including machine learning!).

## Physics

**Fluid Mechanics**

A fun and challenging class where you learn to make friends with differential equations (there is no other choice really).

**Modern Physics**

A good introduction to special relativity and quantum mechanics.
