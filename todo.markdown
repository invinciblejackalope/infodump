Blog post ideas:
* Overleaf documents (math)
* Beatboxing
* Snare drumming + stick tricks
* Toki Pona
* Barbershop, music theory, jazz chords
* Whatever I feel like writing about, isn't that how you're supposed to run a blog?

Development ideas:
* GLSL soon to speed up domain coloring project
* Migrate webpack to Vite?
* Custom theme (Tailwind?)
* More math visuals with jsxgraph, manim, two.js, three.js, ?
