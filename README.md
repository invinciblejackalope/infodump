# infodump

My personal website and info dump.

In the sense of being a receptacle for projects and posts pertaining to my numerous interests. I'm interested in way too many things, and I can't really do anything about it anyway, so I might as well make as much information public as possible if anyone's curious and/or wants to learn about the things I've been learning about.

Some of my interests are actually useful, though definitely not all of them. Also, there are a fair amount of idiosyncratic documents I have, such as a spreadsheet tracking how much time I spend on daily activities, that I think would be entertaining for people to look at. (Hopefully I can make this particular spreadsheet public or at least publish related stats, but I think I should clean it up first since it has a lot of personal info.)

## Progress updates
