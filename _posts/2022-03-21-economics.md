In high school I thought economics was just about businesses and markets. I mean, economics is about businesses and markets, but it's about a whole lot more. In particular, economics could be more broadly summarized as the study of human preferences, decision-making, and exchange. I'm pretty sure the economy only exists *because* humans have to exchange things to get what they need and want.

What I actually thought economics was about (above was a joke).

I originally took econometrics (14.32) on a bit of a whim, since I hadn't heard of the subject before. This turned out to be a completely perspective-changing decision, because I found out that economics was not only [theoretically interesting]({% post_url 2021-12-11-iv-regression %}) but also dealt with a lot of social issues that I really cared about, such as inequalities in earnings and education. Econometrics is the technique by which people rigorously and objectively evaluated these disparities, and then economic theory is a tool we can use to construct and test ways to fix these disparities.

More specifically, econometrics (and statistics in general) is significantly more rigorous than I thought it was. Well, of course it's rigorous, but to an outside observer it can be difficult to see where that rigor comes from. I used to just assume that if we had confounding variables that prevented us from determining a causative pattern, we'd just have to collect better data, but the techniques that people use today are wide-ranging and quite powerful. The biggest technique is probably having a huge number of control variables (on the order of twenty), followed by fixed effects and [IV regression]({% post_url 2021-12-11-iv-regression %}) (same link as before lol). So we actually have quite a lot of data on society with various degrees of uncertainty.

A little snippet of my notes on IV regression, just for fun.

There are things that I've read analyses on that I never thought would be possible to analyze. [One potent example](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.5.1369) concerns the effect of colonialism (specifically, *extractive* colonialism) on long-term economic prosperity. It's pretty clear just sociologically that there should be a significant effect, but econometric techniques allow us to quantify this effect and conclusively dispel counter-theories, such as the effect being produced by differing climates. [Here](https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/87/1/164/5385518) is another paper on extractive colonialism, specifically studying the impact of factories on nearby villages hundreds of years into the future.

Diverging into behavioral economics, a surprising number of things can be explained with relatively simple economic models. Seemingly irrational behaviors regarding things such as insurance and gambling can be explained using the economic models of [risk aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_aversion) and [loss aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion). And by model I mean an actual adjusted utility function with some risk aversion factor or possibly something more complex. Procrastination in all its wacky forms can be explained with [quasi-hyperbolic discounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting#Quasi-hyperbolic_approximation), another adjusted utility function, and sophistication/naivete.

Anyway, I'm excited to learn more economics!
