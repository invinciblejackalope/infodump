I think I originally got into beatboxing from Bigman's original song [Confused](https://youtu.be/7RHTK_zwDkA), which (as I hope you agree after you watch the video *ahem*) was composed of sounds so much richer than I ever imagined could be produced out of a person's mouth. After that, the deeper into beatboxing I got, the more I realized that it's been developed into an art and a community has sprung up around it.

Every year, fans from around the world gather at Grand Beatbox Battle to listen to the world's top professionals perform, e.g. [here](https://youtu.be/JnA7k58trrE) is a compilation from 2021. There are long-time greats such as [D-low](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIrXQGtGouzpjnWBJviZidQ) and [Codfish](https://www.youtube.com/c/BunnyF1uff), plus newer stars like [King Inertia](https://www.youtube.com/c/KINGINERTIA) and [River](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFMQzJ5VZuk-vuZ7TbpQUIw). They compete in a variety of formats, including solo, tag-team, and loopstation. My personal favorite for a while was loopstation, though I think the standard style of beatboxing is much more established and the amount of skill there is ridiculous.

Some of my personal favorite beatboxers have been [Show-Go](https://www.youtube.com/c/SHOWGO), [Gene Shinozaki](https://www.youtube.com/c/gvsbeatbox), and [Helium](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrHv1997). Among loopstation performers, there's also So-So, Saro, and Inkie. Each has an incredibly unique style that I won't elaborate on too much, since there's no point in listening to me ramble about this anyway (just give them a listen yourself).

Before I conclude, it's worth highlighting some of the more unbelievable sounds that people have figured out how to produce. [Stitch's performance](https://youtu.be/UilVHqQxe8Q) for the 2021 GBB Solo Wildcard took the community by storm with his polyphonic voice (first appears around 0:38). I think it's similar to overtone singing, but I'm not sure. I haven't been able to replicate the sound myself. [Inkie's performance](https://youtu.be/wrXz_NUug8E?t=379) at the GBB 2018 loopstation quarterfinals was also quite unprecedented.
