I highly recommend to anyone reading this the practice of [poi spinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poi_(performance_art)). Poi spinning is a form of dance that originated from the [Maori people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_people), the indigenous people of New Zealand. It involves instruments known as poi, which consist of objects attached to flexible tethers.

[Here](https://youtu.be/7GXAapbacBc) is a video of a traditional Maori poi dance.

The art has spread around the world in many different forms, the most well-known of which is probably fire spinning (using poi heads that can be lit on fire). I personally learned poi spinning with glow poi (lit up by LEDs). Here is a long-exposure photo of me spinning glow poi.

There are two main reasons I think poi spinning is interesting.

One, poi spinning requires a strong intuitive sense for manuvering the poi, kind of like juggling, hence the title. Actually, there's an entire genre of dance called [flow arts](https://flowartsinstitute.com/about-us/what-is-flow-arts/) based around this idea. When one gains a strong intuitive understanding of the art, it becomes very natural, and one can enter a [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29) while practicing or performing. This is no different from mastering any other skill, really, but I think the flow arts are particularly interesting because the props begin to feel like an extension of your body.

Two, poi spinning turned out to be a lot more mathematical than I expected. The primary examples of this are poi flowers, which are highly reminiscent of $$r = \sin(k\theta)$$ flowers. For example, the move I was doing in the picture above is known as *static v. triquetra*. *Static* refers to the circle in the middle (a static spin), while *triquetra* refers to the 3 petal flower ($$r = \sin(3\theta)$$). The sheer technicality of the poi world nowadays is immense; static v. triquetra is just barely scratching the surface. [This routine](https://youtu.be/oKxllZKncUI) by Jonathan Alvarez is one demonstration. [This contact poi demonstration](https://youtu.be/tkBu61k6CVU) is another.

So if you're looking for a new hobby that is both physically and mentally engaging, look no further.
